# Microeconomics 23e - By McConnel

#### Limits, Alternatives, and Choices

Chapter 1.1 -
* The reality that the desires within an economic system are limitless whereas the resources of an economic system are limited is the foundation of the social science of how choices are made under scarcity, economics.
* Nothing is free because everything has an assoictaes opportunity cost (or the value of the next best thing given up to take the desired choice).
* As a whole, people's economic choices are considered to be rational because they nearly always make them with a goal in mind (even if that goal is misguided or not the most optimal).
* The general goal of anybody in an economy is too squeeze as much utility out of things as possible. Utility is simply the amount of joy or value derived from a good or service.
* There is a distinct difference ebtween self-interestred behavior and selfish behavior. For example someone may donate to charity out of the self-interest of it bring them pleasure, this does not make them selfish.
* Goods and services are only free if it is part of a business model and if you are not directly burdened with the cost of a good or service remember that it is still being paid my something or someone.
* In economics marginal means a change in something or something additional. Marginal analysis is the scrutiny of additional benefits and costs (typically to make decisions).
* Utility alone can be considered a marginal benefit.
* Oppotunity cost is consdired a marginal cost.
* Because economics is a science it to uses the scientific method. This method is characterized by the following steps: noticing something economically related, creating a hypothesis for why this is, creating a valid test and then seeing if this supports or rejects the original hypothesis, modifying the hypothesis if required, and continuing to test each version of the hypothesis and collecting more and more facts and data. Hypotheses with large amounts of supporting evidence become economic theories and if these thoeries are further supported and accepted they become economic principles (basically laws). Models are created, often of principles, to increase understanding.
* Ecnomic theories, principles, and models are general simplifications that assume ceteris parabis.
* Microeconomics is the social science of economics with the lens tightened specifically on individual units of the economy and specific markets, goods, and services. 
* Macroeconomics, on the other hand, is the social science of collections of units treated as if they were one unit (or an aggregate) as well as total statistics and the general direction of the economy. 
* Microeconomics and Macroecomics are distinct but not separate and my topics are not readily place in either bucket.
* Two types of economics that stretch across the micro-macro economic barrier are normative and positive economics. Positive economics is focused on objective or near-to-it facts. It uses statements that can not really be disputed as they are often the product of science. While this does not mean things presented as postiive economics are fact, it does mean they are not based on opinions. Normative economics concerns statements that fall under what people think "ought to be". Normative economical ideas are where most of the debates in economics lie. 
Chapter 2.2 -
* The economizing problem is the earlier discussed idea that wants exceed means.
* Wants can spiral into more wants at getting a taste of a certain luxury can just move the post farther. "This car is nice. What would it be like to have one that is even better?"
* A budget line is a graphed line that shows all possible variations of purchases between two items (even fractional ones that do not make sense). The area on the side of the origin is what is obtainable whereas the area on the opposite side represents what is unobtainable. To find the x and y intercepts of the budget line, divide the given budget by the price of one item for one intercept and the other item for the other intercept.
* The slope of the line mirrors opportunity cost as you can find out how much of y to get more of x and vice versa.
* Success stories of those who dropped out of college come out of them doing marginal analysis and determining that one route was better than the other. For example, the opportunity cost of not pursuing an NBA career for Kevin Durant was greater than the opportunity cost of not getting a college education. So of course he dropped out after freshman year to go pro.
* The graphed budget line moves to the right with a greater budget and to the left with a smaller budget.
Chapter 1.3 - 
* Economics resources are all of the human, natural, and manufactored resources that go into the process of production.
* Economic resources are the following factors of production: capital, labor, land, and entreprenuerial ability.
* Land is an umbrella term for every naturally-existing factor of production.
* Labor encompases all operations preformed by people for production of good and services.
* Capital in economics is all man-made (tangible or intangible) resources of production. Even just ideas are capital.
	* Money is not considered an economic resources as it does not inheritly aid in the production of goods and services.
* Investments are expenditures to aquire new capital resources. An expenditure that does aquire new capital resources is not considered an investment because new capital was not generated.
* Entrepreneurial ability refers is a special type of human resource that exists outside of labor. It is the ability to use the other three factors of production to make innovations, strategic economic decisions, and take on risk.
* A production positibilities model assumes there is a full use ofavailable resources, that economic resources remain fixed, the technology (ways to produce the outputs of good and services) is constant, and there is only two goods or services being considered.
* Consumer Goods and Services directly satisfy wants through their utility.
* One example of a production possibilities model is a Production Possibilities Table which shows production alternatives where the further you go on one side of the table the closer you get to the full potential of production for one output and further away you get from the full potential of production for the other output being considered.
* Another model showing the same information is when a Production Possibilities Table is expressed graphically as a Production Possibilities Curve (sometimes curve is replaced with frontier).
* All points on the frontier are what is possible if the economy is one hundred percent efficent with the technology and economic resources it has access to. Points on the inside of the curve are still possible but repersent lower effiecency. Points outside of the frontier are impossible levels of production assuming technology and economic resources remain fixed.
* The Law of Increasing Opportunity Costs is the principle that in certain models, the opportunity cost of choosing another unit of x increase the more units of x that have been chosen. If a Production Possibilties Curve is drawn and it is linear, then it does not show the Law of Increasing Opportunity Costs.
	* This law exists becuase not all economic resources are equally suits for producing the two outputs being considered.
* The optimal output is reached when marginal benefits equal marginal costs.
Chapter 1.4 - 
* Economics growth is the result is better economic resources quality and more economic resources. Economic growth is tied to an increase in real output or real output per Capita.
* To correctly apply the economic perspective we must avoid and be on the hunt for biases, be aware of loaded terminology that has emotion in the chamber, falling into the Fallacy of Composition (assuming that if something is true for one piece of the pie than it is true of the entire pie), the Post Hoc Fallacy (assuming that because one thing proceded another thing that the first thing caused the second thing), andconsuming correlation and causation.
